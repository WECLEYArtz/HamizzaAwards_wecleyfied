    <h1>Piracy Policy</h1>
    <h2>We Know Everything. (Literally)</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> of Hamizza website. Here's the deal: </p>
    
    <p class="alert">We're stealing your data. ALL of it.</p>
    
    <p>Your name? Got it. Your location? Oh, we already sent that to everyone in our group chat. Your browser history? BroüíÄ... You should clear that sometime. </p>

    <h2>What We Do With Your Data</h2>
    <p>We're using it to do really important things, like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Figuring out what you had for breakfast.</li>
        <li>Debating whether your fashion sense is worse than your taste in memes.</li>
        <li>using your data to calculate the exact moment you'll regret visiting this site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why You Should Be Concerned</h2>
    <p>
        We already know where you live, and we're thinking about putting it on a billboard downtown.  
        <br>Keep an eye on the mail‚Äîyou might get a postcard with your Wi-Fi password on it. 
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to remain silent, but it won't matter because we can hear you through your webcam anyway.  
       <br>Feel free to complain, but our customer service department is just a potato with a sticky note on it. ü•î
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies to enhance your browsing experience‚Äîor so we claim. In reality, we're analyzing your taste in music and silently judging your playlist choices. and seriously... what's wrong with you? By staying on this site, you agree to let us track your every move. We're watching you... yes, even now. Honestly, we'd probably report you to the police if what we were doing wasn't already borderline illegal. üç™</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We might update this policy someday‚Ä¶ but things will get wrose. Stay tuned. üëçüëç</p>
